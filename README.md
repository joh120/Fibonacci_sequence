Fibonnaci_sequence



Pseudo code
The seq variable is the sum of the previous two numbers in the array.
For example, if the array is [0,1], the next number in the sequence would be 0 + 1 = 1.
The next number in the sequence would be 1 + 1 = 2.

arr[i-1] and arr[i-2] makes the last two in the array. 

arr.push(seq) adds the sum of the last number to the array.
new array would be [0,1,1] then the next iteration happens.
